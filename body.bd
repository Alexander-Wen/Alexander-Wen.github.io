		When I first started longboarding in 2008, I rode a pintail. Recently however, I have switched to a double-drop. Although I prefer a double-drop, it still has its flaws. I plan to build my own longboard out of carbon fiber that suits my personal needs. I currently find that my longboard is a bit too large for my taste. To decrease weight, I can make the board thinner and shorter. What I also found while longboarding, is that there is no braking mechanism. I will have to also implement a braking system.

		Although LaTeX is very functional and useful, it is not intuitive like Microsoft Office or Google Docs. I plan on creating my own version of LaTeX that combines the functionality of LaTeX with the intuitiveness of Microsoft Office.

	>content("Better Keyboard")
		I currently own the Logitech G710+ Mechanical Keyboard with cherry mx brown key switches. Although I really like the keyboard, it has quite a lot of flaws. For example, the number pad has some mathematical operations but not all. It is missing a few key characters such as brackets, the equals key, and the exponent key. This makes typing in mathematical operations into the computer cumbersome. Another problem I found is that although I rarely use the function keys, they take up a lot of space. Since I personally don't use the function keys all that often,I can probably remove them and add a function modifier. Additionally, I also rarely use insert/home/pageup buttons, so those can be removed as well. To improve ergonomics, I would like to split the keyboard, and in the middle have a dock for my phone. The keyboard will have a wireless charger inside of it to charge the phone, and have nfc capabilities to activate certain features such as forwarding all notifications to my computer.

		Every Monday after lectures, the Clean Snowmobile Design Team gets together to work on modifying a snowmobile. The purpose of the team is to take a regular snowmobile, and make it more powerful, while increasing the efficiency.
