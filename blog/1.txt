<p style="font-size: 20px; padding: 15px 0px 15px 0px; margin: 0px;">The College Life</p>
It's been around two months since I've left the comfort of my home in Ottawa
and started the college life at the University of Waterloo. Without my parents
making me food every day, I'm left to either make my own food, or buy food.
Since I don't have time to eat out every day or to make my own food, I had to
find an alternative; I decided to go with canned food. Since the Sobeys near my
residence sells all 14 different kinds of Campbell's Chunky, I decided that I
 will experience every can and rate each can out of ten and write a short paragraph
 describing each can. Wish me luck!
