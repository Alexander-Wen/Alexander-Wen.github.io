					<b>WHO I AM</b>
				</p>
				<h1>Hello World!</h1>
				<p id="content-text">
					My name is Alex and I'm interested in programming, technology, and longboarding. I'm currently
					a first-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.

					<b>WHAT I HAVE BEEN UP TO LATELY</b>
				</p>
				
				<h2>Longboard</h2>
				<p id="content-text">
					When I first started longboarding in 2008, I rode a pintail. Recently however, 
					I have switched to a double-drop. Although I prefer a double-drop, it still has 
					its flaws. I plan to build my own longboard out of carbon fiber that suits my personal 
					needs. I currently find that my longboard is a bit too large for my taste. To decrease 
					weight, I can make the board thinner and shorter. What I also found while longboarding, 
					is that there is no braking mechanism. I will have to also implement a braking system.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Fluid</h2>
				<p id="content-text">
					I am currently working on an application that takes a general 
					template file, and a general body file to generate a fully functioning website.

					<b>WHAT I WILL BE DOING IN THE FUTURE</b>
				</p>
				
				<h2>Better LaTeX</h2>
				<p id="content-text">
					Although LaTeX is very functional and useful, it is not intuitive like Microsoft Office or 
					Google Docs. I plan on creating my own version of LaTeX that combines the functionality of 
					LaTeX with the intuitiveness of Microsoft Office.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Better Keyboard</h2>
				<p id="content-text">
					I currently own the Logitech G710+ Mechanical Keyboard with cherry mx brown key switches. 
					Although I really like the keyboard, it has quite a lot of flaws. For example, the number 
					pad has some mathematical operations but not all. It is missing a few key characters such as 
					brackets, the equals key, and the exponent key. This makes typing in mathematical operations 
					into the computer cumbersome. Another problem I found is that although I rarely use the function 
					keys, they take up a lot of space. Since I personally don't use the function keys all that often,
					I can probably remove them and add a function modifier. Additionally, I also rarely use 
					insert/home/pageup buttons, so those can be removed as well. To improve ergonomics, I would like 
					to split the keyboard, and in the middle have a dock for my phone. The keyboard will have a wireless
					charger inside of it to charge the phone, and have nfc capabilities to activate certain features such
					as forwarding all notifications to my computer.
