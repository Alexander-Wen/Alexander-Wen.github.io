						<h2>Fluid</h2>
						<p id="content-text">
							I am currently working on an application that takes a general 
							template file, and a general body file to generate a fully functioning website.
						</p>
						
						<h2>Longboard</h2>
						<p id="content-text">
							When I first started longboarding in 2008, I rode a pintail. Recently however, 
							I have switched to a double-drop. Although I prefer a double-drop, it still has 
							its flaws. I plan to build my own longboard out of carbon fiber that suits my personal 
							needs. I currently find that my longboard is a bit too large for my taste. To decrease 
							weight, I can make the board thinner and shorter. What I also found while longboarding, 
							is that there is no braking mechanism. I will have to also implement a braking system.

						<h2>Better LaTeX</h2>
						<p id="content-text">
							Although LaTeX is very functional and useful, it is not intuitive like Microsoft Office or 
							Google Docs. I plan on creating my own version of LaTeX that combines the functionality of 
							LaTeX with the intuitiveness of Microsoft Office.
						</p>
						
						<h2>Better Keyboard</h2>
						<p id="content-text">
							I currently own the Logitech G710+ Mechanical Keyboard with cherry mx brown key switches. 
							Although I really like the keyboard, it has quite a lot of flaws. For example, the number 
							pad has some mathematical operations but not all. It is missing a few key characters such as 
							brackets, the equals key, and the exponent key. This makes typing in mathematical operations 
							into the computer cumbersome. Another problem I found is that although I rarely use the function 
							keys, they take up a lot of space. Since I personally don't use the function keys all that often,
							I can probably remove them and add a function modifier. Additionally, I also rarely use 
							insert/home/pageup buttons, so those can be removed as well. To improve ergonomics, I would like 
							to split the keyboard, and in the middle have a dock for my phone. The keyboard will have a wireless
							charger inside of it to charge the phone, and have nfc capabilities to activate certain features such
							as forwarding all notifications to my computer.
