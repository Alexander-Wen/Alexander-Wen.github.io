<b>WHAT I WILL BE DOING IN THE FUTURE</b>
</p>
<h2>Ece is hard</h2>
<p id="content-text">
Everyone in Electrical and Computer Engineering already know that out program isn't the easiest of programs. I will be creating a website that will act as a course and professor rating website. Users are able to rate courses and professors and from that data a number of times us ECE students have been screwed over will be compiled.
</p>
<h2>Ece is not hard</h2>
<p id="content-text">
Although ECE is a hard program, there are lots of online resources for students to use. I plan to create a website that compiles all the online resources and notes that ECE students have used in one convenient location. This website will be aimed to help fellow classmates, and lower years.
</p>
<h2>Togle</h2>
<p id="content-text">
This project was started at a UofT Hacks. Currently, Togle is a smart outlet that can be controlled from anywhere in the world using either a pebble, myo, android device, or a pc. It also has the unique feature of being able to detect when a plugged in device is at full charge and knows when to turn on and off to prevent over charge. In the near future this project will be expanded so that multiple outlets can be supported, and the apps will be more streamlined and more efficient.
</p>
<h2>Better LaTeX</h2>
<p id="content-text">
Although LaTeX is very functional and useful, it is not intuitive like Microsoft Office or Google Docs. I plan on creating my own version of LaTeX that combines the functionality of LaTeX with the intuitiveness of Microsoft Office.
</p>
<h2>Better Keyboard</h2>
<p id="content-text">
I currently own the Logitech G710+ Mechanical Keyboard with cherry mx brown key switches. Although I really like the keyboard, it has quite a lot of flaws. For example, the number pad has some mathematical operations but not all. It is missing a few key characters such as brackets, the equals key, and the exponent key. This makes typing in mathematical operations into the computer cumbersome. Another problem I found is that although I rarely use the function keys, they take up a lot of space. Since I personally don't use the function keys all that often,I can probably remove them and add a function modifier. Additionally, I also rarely use insert/home/pageup buttons, so those can be removed as well. To improve ergonomics, I would like to split the keyboard, and in the middle have a dock for my phone. The keyboard will have a wireless charger inside of it to charge the phone, and have nfc capabilities to activate certain features such as forwarding all notifications to my computer.
